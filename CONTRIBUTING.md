## Contribute to GitLab

If you want to contribute to GitLab, follow this process:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a feature branch
3. Code
4. Create a pull request

We will only accept pull requests if:

* Your code has proper tests and all tests pass
* Your code can be merged w/o problems
* It won't break existing functionality
* It's quality code
* We like it :)

For examples of feedback on pull requests please look at the [closed pull requests](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed).

## Installation

Install the Gitlab development in a virtual machine with the [Gitlab Vagrant virtual machine](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-vagrant-vm). Installing it in a virtual machine makes it much easier to set up all the dependencies for integration testing.

## Running tests

For more information on running the tests please read the [development tips](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/development.md)
